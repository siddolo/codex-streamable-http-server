# The Codex CLI login mechanism binds an HTTP server to TCP port 1455 to receive the OAuth 2.0 callback.
# Since the binding is hardcoded to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 and cannot be configured, itâ€™s not possible
# to expose the service to the host directly from Docker.
# This workaround creates a DNAT rule to bypass this limitation.
